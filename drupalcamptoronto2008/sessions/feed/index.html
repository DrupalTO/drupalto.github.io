 <title>Drupal on a Diet, Keeping your site lean and light</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/drupal-a-diet-keeping-your-site-lean-and-light</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal by default is very lean, only when functionality and design are added does performance become an issue. With some sites using hundreds of modules, the responsibility is on the developer to insure that modules have the smallest possible impact. Themes can also help to lubricate the Drupal experience in presentation style and technique.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>What’s the right image solution for my site?</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/what%E2%80%99s-right-image-solution-my-site</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many different approaches to handle images on your site, but which one is the best approach for yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session will cover the pros/cons of different solutions that are out there in relation to the needs of your site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, I’m creating this session because when I first started with Drupal, what was the best approach would often make me want to bang my head against my desk. So, to prevent any future concussions, I’d like to pass along my experiences with different modules.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Moving in: how to port your content from * to Drupal</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/moving-how-port-your-content-drupal</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;You&#039;ve decided to make the switch to Drupal. Fantastic! Only one problem: you have to figure out how to move your content from the old database to Drupal. Although there are many &lt;a href=&quot;http://drupal.org/project/Modules/category/64&quot;&gt;import/export modules available&lt;/a&gt; it&#039;s sometimes good to know what&#039;s happening behind the scenes. This session will walk you through my adventures of porting community Web sites into Drupal.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Managing Your Drupal Project with SVN + Trac</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/managing-your-drupal-project-with-svn-trac</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently led a session on this for the Toronto Drupal Users&#039; Group.  It went reasonably well so I&#039;d be willing to do it again.  There should be more time at DrupalCamp; it won&#039;t be necessary to rush through slides this time.  We may even have time to talk more about alternate strategies.  There will be more folks present, those who missed it the first time and those from out of town, so we should be able to get into a much wider discussion.  And now I know how to get my laptop to work with the projector! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Non-Profit Drupalling, A view from the inside</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/non-profit-drupalling-a-view-inside</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;One year ago, Standardbred Canada had a problem. Saddled with a proprietary and outdated CMS, new initiatives and development was next to impossible. The decision was made that change was needed. Thus a project to convert the full functionality of the existing Standardbred Canada website, including the leveraging of live data collected from race tracks across Canada into a fully featured Drupal site came to be.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Drupal Usability : Looking at the Drupal UI from a Subject Oriented Perspective</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/drupal-usability-looking-drupal-ui-a-subject-oriented-perspective</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Subject Oriented Design is a much needed and logical follow up to Object Oriented Design – but what is it and how can it help with improving the usability of Drupal&#039;s administration interface? To &lt;em&gt;begin&lt;/em&gt; to answer these questions I’m proposing a session with these goals:&lt;br /&gt;
•	To explore some of the meaning and importance of subject oriented design.&lt;br /&gt;
•	To encourage Drupal designers and developers to look at their work from a subject oriented perspective.&lt;br /&gt;
•	To share some practical hints as to how to go about this. (Given that it&#039;s an endless journey we can only take a few steps in one session.)&lt;br /&gt;
•	To loosen some of the right bolts in the Drupal UX paradigm while still keeping the architectural pivot points in tact.&lt;br /&gt;
•	To help me, as a usability expert and Drupal newcomer, understand more about what matters to you, as developers, designers and users of Drupal.&lt;br /&gt;
•	To establish that Salsa dancing is the best benchmark around for evaluating user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>BOF: Drupal scalability and performance for large web sites</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/bof-drupal-scalability-and-performance-large-web-sites</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Success for a web site is often measured by traffic (more page views, more visitors, ...etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sites can be victims to their own success when increased popularity causes it to be slow, or unable to handle more page views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some things that we will touch on and discuss:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the symptoms to look for?
&lt;li&gt;What are the areas you investigate for problems?
&lt;li&gt;What tools are available to help you diagnose issues?
&lt;li&gt;What are some hints and tips for making your site faster?

 <title>Case Study: Mozilla extension hosting with Drupal for ActiveState </title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/case-study-mozilla-extension-hosting-with-drupal-activestate</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;This talk is a short case-study on how to quickly implement hosting for exotic content types in Drupal using Komodo extension hosting functionality on community.activestate.com as an example. I&#039;ll walk users through the current implementation in pieces and discuss the major points such as:&lt;br /&gt;
- how the initial design goals guided the implementation&lt;br /&gt;
- handling special file types using cck tricks and the formapi&lt;br /&gt;
- implementing the extension update service either inside of Drupal, or as a separate script&lt;br /&gt;
- using simpletest for unit testing of the service&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Moderating content in Drupal</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/moderating-content-drupal</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In this workshop, we will talk about moderating content generated by users (and maybe non-users) in Drupal. If you have a site with lots of user generated content, you may have already run into spam or other forms of abuse intended towards readers of your site. We will take a look at:&lt;br /&gt;
 * Current solution offered by drupal&lt;br /&gt;
 * What Mollom aims to solve&lt;br /&gt;
 * Current solutions offered by third party modules (flag_content, troll, abuse)&lt;br /&gt;
 * Ideas and other solutions from the community on tackling this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Online Advocacy - What&#039;s it is, what&#039;s out there, what&#039;s working, what needs work (Saturday, May 24th)</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/online-advocacy-whats-it-whats-out-there-whats-working-what-needs-work-saturday-may-24th</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of the Information Superhighway has changed democracy (and it&#039;s nastier, slower cousin, politics) forever.   A number of groups and individuals are trying to change the world, and open source online tools are one of the most effective tactics they have at their disposal. The possibilities for educating, connecting and mobilizing citizens to push for change are opened up by new online tools.  Big words, but what does this have to do with Drupal?&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Automated Testing with SimpleTest</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/automated-testing-with-simpletest</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;SimpleTest is a unit-testing framework written in PHP that is becoming an integral part of the Drupal development process. Whether you&#039;re hacking core, working on a pet module, or managing a complicated project, regular and proper use of unit tests in Drupal can lead to happy developers and code that glows with correctness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk will tackle the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* What is unit testing, and why is it useful?&lt;br /&gt;
* When should it be used?&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Using Actions and Triggers in Drupal 6</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/using-actions-and-triggers-drupal-6</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;In this session we will look at the Drupal 6 API for actions and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this section is to demystify actions and triggers for developers and site administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will look at the actions and triggers already preconfigured in Drupal and how to use them in your site.  We will also learn how to define new actions and triggers within modules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of this session will involve looking at code so a knowledge of PHP would be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This session is based on a session i attended at Drupalcon Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Building Database Applications in the Drupal CMS</title>
 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/building-database-applications-drupal-cms</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;Drupal is a great content management platform.  But some projects require more than just content management greatness.  For projects that involve building web enabled database applications, you need to model custom systems that don&#039;t exist in any module.  Then you need a way to plug your custom application into your Drupal site alongside all the other content that Drupal is presenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeform Solutions has spent several years developing a database application modeling tool called Formulize, that can be integrated with Drupal websites, as well as other PHP systems.&lt;/p&gt;

 <link>http://2008.drupalcamptoronto.org/content/drupy-drupal-implemented-python</link>
 <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://drupy.net/&quot;&gt;Drupy&lt;/a&gt; is a Python port of the Drupal content management system. At the moment, it is at bootstrap phase 5. The objective is to make it as easy as possible for core and contribs Drupal developers to port their existing code to Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this session, Clifford Ilkay will provide a quick overview and answer questions about Drupy.&lt;/p&gt;
